React Server
======================

Basic framework for MQTT connections within an escape room setup.

This project currently implements the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.JS, Node.JS) stack.
Please note that MongoDB is not active within the project. The user must set this up in the server.js file themselves and add their own routes and schemas but the basic code is there.

## Installation

`npm install`

`npm dev`
